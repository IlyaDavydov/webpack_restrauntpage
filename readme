From a content and functionality standpoint, this project is rather straightforward. However, it holds significance because its main goal was to delve into webpack and JavaScript module systems. Through this project, I've acquired the following skills:

1. Webpack:
Learned how to bundle projects
Familiarized myself with basic concepts and commands in the webpack.config.js file
Utilized HtmlWebpackPlugin for generating HTML files
Employed loaders to handle images, fonts, and styles
Configured DevServer for automatic project rebuilds on changes
Mastered deployment to GitHub Pages
Gained understanding of basic concepts and commands in the package.json file

2.JavaScript Modules:
Experimented with a new approach to dynamically changing content on the page when switching between tabs using import and export functions from different files. Each tab represents a separate page.
